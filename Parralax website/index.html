        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Sora is a text-to-video generative AI model, released by OpenAI in February 2024. The model is trained to generate videos of realistic or imaginative scenes from text instructions and show potential in simulating the physical world. Based on public technical reports and reverse engineering, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the model's background, related technologies, applications, remaining challenges, and future directions of text-to-video AI models. We first trace Sora's development and investigate the underlying technologies used to build this "world simulator".

        <h2>Text to video</h2>
        <p>Meet Sora - OpenAI's new text-to-video generator. The tool, which the San Francisco company unveiled Thursday, uses generative artificial intelligence to instantly create short videos based on written commands.
        <br>Sora isn't the first to demonstrate this kind of technology. But industry analysts point to the high quality of the tool's videos displayed so far, and note that its introduction marks a significant leap for both OpenAI andthe future of text-to-video generation overall.

        <p>The top AI video Generators
            Utilise these tools to use AI to create, edit, and improve videos.
            There are tools that will help you do anything you want: managing your own YouTube channel, producing more interesting material for social media, or reusing content to keep all of your business's online channels fresh. These tools range from intelligent video editing software to generative text-to-video apps. Here are my recommendations for the top AI video generators following a week of testing.
